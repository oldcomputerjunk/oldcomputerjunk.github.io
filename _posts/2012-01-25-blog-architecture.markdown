I think I might split out extended how-to into separate Pages somehow, with much shorter blog entries.  That way the main page wont look so cluttered, and I want my blog to be readable by more than just people who understand source code...
Problem is my current theme doesn't seem to have much support for extended menu development.
There seem to be some wiki-type plugins for Wordpress but then it just got too late so I left it for now.
Another alternative is some kind of TL;DR button to get to the longer technical stuff which would be hidden somehow by default in the main page yet remain visible when the article is the URL.
Some homework to do...
