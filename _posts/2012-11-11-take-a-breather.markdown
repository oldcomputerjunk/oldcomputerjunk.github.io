After an overly hectic six months I have a week off, woot!

I have a backlog of tech stuff to blog about.

I just purchased my ticket to [LCA2013](http://linux.conf.au) in Canberra at the end of January.  I am intending to get there Sunday arvo to go to the newcomers session, technically I am not a newcomer as such any more, but I missed it last year which was my first.

It turns out that I am going to get to [OSDC](http://www.osdc.com.au/) in Sydney next month as well.

Fun times ahead :-)


While I was typing this, there was a bushfire (really a scrub fire) 20k north of our place - my wife is out there somewhere in command of a CFS truck.  I took the photo an hour ago, and now I walked out for another look the smoke has subsided, so they seem to have it under control.[![Fire north of Avon](http://blog.oldcomputerjunk.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/avonfire1-300x225.jpg)](http://blog.oldcomputerjunk.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/avonfire1.jpg)
