I have been experimenting with using [dynamic DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dns) with a view to being able to remotely login to home to "check the chickens" via a webcam.

Free DNS seems to be a useful and uncomplicated service.  One of the pages politely asked for a link, and seeing as this is a free service I am more than happy to oblige.

So:

For all your Dynamic DNS needs, check out [Free DNS](http://freedns.afraid.org). [[http://freedns.afraid.org](http://freedns.afraid.org)]
