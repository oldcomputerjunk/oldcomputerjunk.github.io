Again instead of focusing on tech stuff I am sharing my personal experiences, hopefully this may prove useful to others in the future.

There is a great [First Timers Guide](http://www.darkmere.gen.nz/2007/0129.html) and of course the main [site](http://linux.conf.au) and wiki.  But I thought I would make a list of some LCA hints and gotchas in no particular order (apart from coffee!)  Note I personally only stumbled into some of these, the rest I have garnered in conversations and third hand... of course all involved remain anonymous...








  * Most important: Coffee.  Get to the Cafe early so you have time to get served before keynote / session, there is a long queue in the morning!


  * During breaks just walk up to a table and introduce yourself - this really works well!


  * Get there Sunday arvo there is an Intro session (which I missed unfortunately)


  * Be prepared to become an event organiser if you suggest an event :-) - and a big thank you to the organising committee!


  * Don't press ENTER to tweet too soon especially during a keynote


  * For those in accommodation, take care not to lose door passes, tags or accidentally let doors shut behind you


  * Don't put empty coffee cups in your bag they can still leak the leftovers (yuck)


  * Secure (attach) your USB keys to something


  * If you don't want to keep fiddling with your phone print out the schedule before you come (or get a better phone)


  * (Important) Take time out to reflect and take a breather and catch up it is easy to become overwhelmed.





I have been trying to keep track of everyone I meet and reply to all email and tweet and SMS but I think I will be fighting a loosing battle to keep that up - so sorry in advance especially as I have trouble with placing and remembering names and faces sometimes! 

Edit - also, buy a [raffle ticket](http://bit.ly/zbANA9).
