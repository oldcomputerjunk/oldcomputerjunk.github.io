Well, I've said it before and not followed through, but I am intending to blog about various stuff from last weeks LCA over the next month or two.

One things about LCA of course is how much you learn. Especially when you stand up in front of a room to share something and discover errors in your own understanding! In my own case, I had a talk at the Open Hardware miniconf about some security things related to embedded devices. Literally an hour before I had a ping on twitter alterting me to a factual error in my blog, which was also loudly proclaimed in the talk I was about to deliver. Luckily it was only one slide, and the misunderstanding did not impact the rest of the talk (or for that matter, most of the offending blog article.) So I have updated the [original blog article](http://blog.oldcomputerjunk.net/2014/experiments-with-hardening-openwrt-applying-the-grsecurity-patches/) with a correction.
