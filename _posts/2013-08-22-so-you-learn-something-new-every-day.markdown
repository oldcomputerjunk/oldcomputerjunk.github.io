So today I discovered [xclip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/), when perusing the GitHub [ssh](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) instructions.  

A tool in the traditional unix sense, xclip does nothing but redirect input to or read from the clipboard, allowing clipboard manipulation from the command line or shell script.  Awesome - how come I didn't I already know this!

Available as a Debian [package](http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=xclip), and almost certainly in other distributions.

I have in the past programatically modified the clipboard, from Javascript and Python at different times, but although this tool has been around a while I never managed to pay attention before. Serendipity FTW! 

Hmm, I wonder if I shouldn't make this a series, so that I keep regularly posting even when time is short...
