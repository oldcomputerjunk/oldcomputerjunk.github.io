I decided to go to [linux.conf.au](http://linux.conf.au/) 2012 to be held in Ballarat in Victoria in January.
This is a little bit out of my comfort zone as I will only know one person there, and have never been the most confident at meeting new people.
On top of which I have been somewhat less than active in online communities until now, so I will be a bit 'reputationless'
I have been a big user of open source software at home and where possible professionally for over a decade now, and as time permits I am looking for opportunities to give back subject to family time commitments.  I figure I may as well start by actually meeting some like-minded people in person.
