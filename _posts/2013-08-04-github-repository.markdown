I created a [github](http://github.com) for some of the scripts I posted here.
In particular my script for using the [Huawei e173 from Debian Squeeze](http://blog.oldcomputerjunk.net/2011/optus-huawei-e173-or-e1752-in-debian-squeeze/) seems to be popular, so I put that up first.

Its over at [https://github.com/oldcomputerjunk](https://github.com/oldcomputerjunk) - enjoy!
