At [linux.conf.au](http://linux.conf.au) there may still be raffle tickets left for sale, from the registration desk, there are great prizes - most importantly this is in support of the CFA - I like this as my dear wife is a CFS volunteer (Country Fire Service - the South Australian equivalent.)

They fight fires but also attend country car accidents and may save your life one day.

In South Australia you can even [monitor](http://www.cfs.sa.gov.au/site/news_media/current_incidents.jsp) going incidents.
In Victoria the CFA also has a [graphical](http://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/warnings-and-incidents/index.htm) system.
