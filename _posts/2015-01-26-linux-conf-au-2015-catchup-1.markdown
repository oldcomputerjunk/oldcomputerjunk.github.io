At the conference in Auckland I had two presentations.

For the first time I managed to get a main conference talk accepted, actually it was a tutorial which goes for 90 minutes! It was a bit daunting beforehand, but after I finished, I realised I prefer the tutorial format over having to deliver a talk. I enjoy the interaction with the audience and the sharing of knowledge, and also not being the sole focus (and not having to remember exactly what to say so much!)

My tutorial was on Reverse Engineering with Radare2; the video ([Youtube](http://youtu.be/R3sGlzXfEkU)) and [slides](http://lca2015.linux.org.au/slides/138/radare2_tutorial.pdf) are linked from the conference presentation, and have the [slides](http://andrewmcdonnell.net/slides/lca2015_radaretutorial.pdf) up on my personal landing page as well. Thanks to James for helping with a final practice run, its always good to have a typical candidate audience perspective beforehand.

I also did a shorter talk at the Open Hardware mini-conference, on hardening embedded Linux, using OpenWRT on devices like the carambola2 as an example.  The [video of the mini-conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mSz7Xprl0&feature=youtu.be) is a bit less polished due to resourcing, here I am on about 2/3 the way through.  I was somewhat more flustered in my delivery due to late changes to some slides (see earlier blog article) and a problem with my laptop deciding to have thermal issues an hour before the talk.  I managed to resolve these (thanks AndyK for your help!) but it put me off my mojo a bit unfortunately. The live demo I was quite happy with, it worked without issue, so perhaps the demo gods were appeased by my earlier mishaps...  The final slides are [here](http://andrewmcdonnell.net/slides/lca2015_openhardware.pdf).
