Welcome to my personal blog.  My name is Andrew, and computing and technology has been my lifelong passion.

From time to time I talk about various computing problems I solved. Or not. Or other things. In the hope the information might prove of use to somebody else.

MyÂ  wife keeps reminding me I have too much Old Computer Junk.

Hence the name ...
